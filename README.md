Hello. My name is Alex. I have solved the task. I used 2 threads, first - extracts links and extract Jsoap data, second - extract properties and create object Product, write to the CSV file. I used different random userAgent it depends on Linux or Windows OS, connection to the site has random pause to avoid an antibot guard on site. I faced a problem with the main page, it has dynamic content. I think that some special tool exists to read the whole main page. Thank you!
